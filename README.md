# Prusa-MK3-Material-Profiles
A collection of Slic3r profiles for a variety of materials for the Prusa i3 MK3

The Excel sheet contained within this repository serves as a record of which profiles were used for which specific material. 

These are not what I would consider 'production grade' material profiles, some of these profiles are more mature than others, see the excel sheet for notes. 

I use the Benchy model to do all my filament testing, so these profiles are built around successfully printing a Benchy.
